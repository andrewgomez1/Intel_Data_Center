Determining the most optimal location to build a new data center for Intel

> **This Project**


> By meticulously analyzing a wealth of geographical and infrastructural data, I aim to pinpoint regions that not only offer robust connectivity and scalability but also align with Intel's overarching business objectives. Through this multidimensional approach, I seek to provide actionable insights that will empower Intel to make informed decisions, ensuring the seamless expansion of its data infrastructure while maximizing operational effectiveness and minimizing costs.

> **SQL**


In this project, I utilized SQL to conduct exploratory data analysis and prepare the data for visualization using Tableau. Through a series of SQL queries, I extracted, transformed, and analyzed large datasets to gain insights into various factors influencing the optimal location for Intel's new data center.

The initial phase involved querying the raw data to perform exploratory analysis, uncovering patterns, trends, and potential correlations. These queries provided a comprehensive understanding of the dataset, allowing for informed decision-making during subsequent stages.

Additionally, I created specialized queries to filter and refine the dataset, extracting only the relevant information needed for the visualization process in Tableau. By selectively shrinking the data to essential variables, I optimized performance and enhanced the efficiency of the visualization process.

> **My Findings**


Intel has a goal to acheive 100% renewable energy across global manufacturing operations by 2030. Therefore, I sought out the regions with the highest renewable energy percentage. This led me to a deeper understanding of the regions we should stray away from - such as Florida (4%), the Carolinas (5%), and the Mid-Atlantic (6%) - and the regions to strongly consider -  Northwest (52%) and Central (41%).

Building a data center in a region that has a surplus of energy is crucial. Data centers require a consistent and reliable power supply to ensure uninterrupted operations. A surplus of energy reduces the risk of power shortages or outages, safeguarding against potential disruptions to critical services and data processing. Additionally, regions with surplus energy often offer competitive pricing for electricity, reducing operating costs for data center operators. This led to the analysis of net energy production in different regions. We can conclude that the Northwest region (21.7 million MW) has the second highest net production behind the Mid-Atlantic (31.7 million MW). However, as balance is so critical, the low percentage of renewable energy produced in the Mid-Atlantic outweighs this immense surplus.

I further explored the total fossil fuels and renewable energy generated in each northwest state to narrow down specifically which state would be the ideal location. I found that Washington leads all northwest states with almost triple the amount of renewable energy produced than second place (OR). To put a cherry on top, Washington has nearly the least amount of fossil fuel generated of the northwest group.

> **Conclusion**


After an exhaustive analysis of energy generation, environmental sustainability, cost efficiency, and reliability factors across northwest states, it becomes evident that Washington emerges as the optimal choice for the establishment of a new data center. With a substantial portion of its energy generated from renewable sources, particularly hydroelectric power, Washington offers a compelling blend of environmental consciousness and energy abundance.

Furthermore, the state's commitment to renewable energy development, coupled with favorable energy costs and a robust energy grid, reinforces its position as a prime location for data center operations. By selecting Washington as the preferred site, stakeholders can leverage its renewable energy assets to not only meet their operational needs but also contribute to a greener, more sustainable future.
